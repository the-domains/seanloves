Curriculum Vitae

I've worked as a Photographer, DP, DIT, Editor, Director, Audio technician, Fixer, Casting director, Artist, Philosopher, Driver, you name it! But I don't call myself any of those things, I do whatever is needed to create and enable the vision to happen. Working in this industry and running a small video production company I've learned that it's always collaborative and super rewarding when one works with great people and everybody pulls in the same direction. I've also come to enjoy all aspects of work in this industry, from meeting clients and helping them craft their ideas, to planning and executing the logistics of making those ideas a reality.

I'm friendly by nature with an open heart but I'm also able to stay focused and deliver projects under pressure. I often work independently but love collaboration and getting the best out of people. 

Continuously coming up with fresh and innovative ideas, keeping different consumers interested and challenging myself whilst learning is what it's all about. 

Photographically I have experience working with products, still life, people, fashion and architecture, creating high quality imagery. Fascinated with the craft of image making in a fast paced environment, I believe it requires deep thought, great preparation and the ability to react to changes when necessary. 

My entrepreneurial spirit is what has pushed me to keep trying new things, to learn new art forms, techniques, business practices and allowed my creativity to work in tandem with my quest for knowledge.

Thank you for your time and consideration

Sean

**PROFILE**

Photographer, DOP and Filmmaker interested in people and their stories. Highly entrepreneurial and dedicated. My artistic background is painting, and this discipline teaches one to look, really look at something before attempting to create a picture.

_CREATIVE DIRECTOR, MONKEYSWAG; MANCHESTER, UK --- 2011-2014_

I joined this small e-commerce business when it was essentially an eBay shop. Position was varied and wide ranging. Opened up e-commerce channels, created a new website and implemented streamlined workflows. Increased turnover 500%. Installed a photography studio and learned a great deal about still life photography and how to photograph watches and small reflective objects. We successfully captured a large portion of a niche watch-strap market by utilising imagery that was above and beyond what anyone else was doing at the time, while remaining competitive on pricing and offering a level of service that was unsurpassed.

_E-TRADER, SELF EMPLOYED, ASIA & EUROPE --- 2009-2011_

During these years I was based in Hong Kong and the UK. I travelled throughout Asia and Europe sourcing niche and unique products which I brought to online markets. During this time I learned the importance of great photography as a means to sell online and also developed negotiation skills and a positive business attitude.

_ARTIST, SELF EMPLOYED/Golden Camel, LONDON --- 2007-2009_

Spent a year in a studio in Broadway Market painting and illustrating. Culminating in a solo exhibition of the work and sold everything. The next year I opened an art gallery for emerging artists which exhibited local work, allowed artists to use a collaborative space and we also had a little shop.

_MANAGER, Rays & Co, MANCHESTER 2004-2007_

Wholesale catering delivery business. I managed the operations of this long standing business fulfilling the needs of existing customers and also sourcing new clients. Position was wide ranging and included time on the road as a delivery driver, which I must say; I enjoyed thoroughly!
