Curriculum Vitae

### _PROFILE_

Photographer, DOP and Filmmaker interested in people and their stories. Highly entrepreneurial and dedicated. My artistic background is painting, and this discipline teaches one to look, really look at something before attempting to create a picture.

### _EXPERIENCE_

**DIRECTOR, CAPSLOCK LTD; LONDON, UK --- 2014-2017**

Co-founded a small company in 2014 as a creative start up collaboration with Swedish business partner. We offer video production, photographic services, sound design, creative writing and develop ideas for the TV and film industry. Based at The Sharp Project, a digital hub housing approximately 60 companies all working in the digital, photographic, TV and film sector. Link

**CREATIVE DIRECTOR, MONKEYSWAG; MANCHESTER, UK --- 2011-2014**

I joined this small e-commerce business when it was essentially an eBay shop. Position was varied and wide ranging. Opened up e-commerce channels, created a new website and implemented streamlined workflows. Increased turnover 500%. Installed a photography studio and learned a great deal about still life photography and how to photograph watches and small reflective objects. We successfully captured a large portion of a niche watch-strap market by utilising imagery that was above and beyond what anyone else was doing at the time, while remaining competitive on pricing and offering a level of service that was unsurpassed.

**E-TRADER, SELF EMPLOYED, ASIA & EUROPE --- 2009-2011**

During these years I was based in Hong Kong and the UK. I travelled throughout Asia and Europe sourcing niche and unique products which I brought to online markets. During this time I learned the importance of great photography as a means to sell online and also developed negotiation skills and a positive business attitude.

**ARTIST, SELF EMPLOYED/Golden Camel, LONDON --- 2007-2009**

Spent a year in a studio in Broadway Market painting and illustrating. Culminating in a solo exhibition of the work and sold everything. The next year I opened an art gallery for emerging artists which exhibited local work, allowed artists to use a collaborative space and we also had a little shop.

**MANAGER, Rays & Co, MANCHESTER 2004-2007**

Wholesale catering delivery business. I managed the operations of this long standing business fulfilling the needs of existing customers and also sourcing new clients. Position was wide ranging and included time on the road as a delivery driver, which I must say; I enjoyed thoroughly!
